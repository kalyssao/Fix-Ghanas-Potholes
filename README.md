## This is a repository for the Ghana Pothole Tracker system.
It runs on a raspberry pi and uses image classification methods to determine the presence of potholes on a road in realtime, and transmits the co-ordinates of said potholes to a MySQL database.
These co-ordinates are then plotted on a web application to inform user's route selection. Additionally, they are available for download.

The purpose of this project is to introduce an element of crowdsourcing for civil good in user journeys, making it easier for the mobile maintenance units (MMU's) to gather data about road improvement projects.
